# Keylogger Project using Python and Pynput

## Introduction
Welcome to the Keylogger project repository! This project demonstrates a simple keylogger implementation using the `pynput` library in Python. A keylogger is a tool that records and captures keystrokes made by users on their computers. While keyloggers can have legitimate use cases, they can also be misused for malicious purposes, so always use such tools responsibly and legally.This readme provides an overview of the project, instructions for running the keylogger, and safety precautions to ensure responsible use.
**Disclaimer: This project is for educational purposes only. It cannot be used for any malicious activity as it will only run inside a python IDE.**

## Features
- Records all keyboard inputs (keystrokes) made by the user.
- Stores the captured data locally in a text file.
- Automatically starts recording when the program is executed and gets terminated, when we enter the Esc key.
- Runs in a Python IDE with no impact on system resources.

## Requirements
Before running the keylogger, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python (version 3.8 or later)
- Pynput library (install via `pip install pynput`)
